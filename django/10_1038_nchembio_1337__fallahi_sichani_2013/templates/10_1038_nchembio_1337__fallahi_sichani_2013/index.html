<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Large-scale analysis of cellular response to anti-cancer drugs typically
focuses on variation in potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) assuming that it is the most
important difference between effective/ineffective drugs or sensitive/resistant
cells.

We took a multi-parametric approach to analyzing a large set of dose response
curves generated in the Gray Lab and reported originally in <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018854108">Heiser et al.</a> with
additional help from <a
href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/people/nicholas-wang.cfm">Nick
Wang</a>. Our approach involved analysis of the slope of the dose-response curve
(HS), the area under the curve (AUC) and the maximum effect (E<sub>max</sub>).
We found that some of these parameters vary systematically with cell line and
others with drug class. For cell-cycle inhibitors, E<sub>max</sub> often but not
always correlated with cell proliferation rate. For drugs targeting the
Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway dose-response curves were unusually shallow. Classical
pharmacology has no ready explanation for this phenomenon but single-cell
analysis showed that it correlated with significant and heritable cell-to-cell
variability in the extent of target inhibition. We conclude that parameters
other than potency should be considered in the comparative analysis of drug
response, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations near and above
IC<sub>50</sub>. </p>

<h2>A multi-parametric approach to quantifying variability in cancer drug response</h2>
<p class="normal">Patient-to-patient variability in drug response is a primary challenge facing development and use of new medicines. A recent approach to understanding such variability involves genotyping coupled with systematic measurement of dose-response across a large and diverse bank (“encyclopedia”) of cell lines. Dose-response data are conventionally analyzed from the perspective of IC<sub>50</sub> (potency) values (or similar parameters) which are descriptive of the shape of the dose-response curve at its mid-point.  However, inspection of dose-response curves reveals that they differ substantially in shape from one drug to the next and from one cell line to the next. Variability in shape can be quantified by performing a multi-parametric analysis using a conventional logistical sigmoidal function. Among these parameters, EC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub> and GI<sub>50</sub> are the classic measures of drug potency and E<sub>max</sub> and E<sub>inf</sub> are measures of drug efficacy. Hill slope (HS) represents the steepness of the curve, and area under the curve (AUC) combines potency and efficacy of a drug into a single parameter. </p>

The red dash line represents the simple case of E<sub>0</sub> = 1, E<sub>max</sub> = E<sub>inf</sub>  = 0, EC<sub>50</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub> and HS = 1.

<h2>Dose-response parameters vary with compound and cell line</h2>
<p class="normal">We focused on analysis of dose-response data comprising CellTiter-Glo measurement of per-well ATP levels (a metric of metabolically active cells) for 64 anti-cancer drugs and 53 well-characterized breast cell lines. Multi-parametric analysis yielded values for EC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub>, GI<sub>50</sub>, HS (Hill slope), E<sub>inf</sub>, E<sub>max</sub> and AUC for 2789 drug/cell line combinations (<a href="http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/datasets/20120">data</a>) and revealed substantial differences from one drug and cell line to the next.</p>

<h2>Different types of variation in dose-response relationships</h2>
<p class="normal">Across breast cell lines, IC<sub>50</sub> varied ~10<sup>4</sup>-fold and E<sub>max</sub> from 0-0.8 for the microtubule stabilizer docetaxel and HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, whereas IC<sub>50</sub> varied little for the CDK4/cyclin D1 kinase inhibitor fascaplysin (ca. 10-fold) and maximum effect was high in all cases (E<sub>max</sub> ~ 0). In the case of the PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458, Hill slope was ~1.0, whereas it varied significantly for the polyamine analogue CGC-11144.</p>
<p class="normal img-wrapper">

<h2>Different dose-response parameters do not always correlate with each other</h2>
<p class="normal">Potency, maximal effect and slope were well-correlated only for a subset of drugs and cell lines. For example, whereas IC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> correlated in the case of geldanamycin they did not for the PI3K inhibitor GSK1059615. IC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> were generally more highly correlated than GI<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> (e.g. for the Src/Abl inhibitor bosutinib: <i>P</i> = 10<sup>-11</sup> vs. <i>P</i> = 0.03). Thus, parameters we might assume to be interchangeable (e.g. IC<sub>50</sub> and GI<sub>50</sub>) were not, implying that different dose-response parameters convey different information.</p>

<h2>Association of E<sub>max</sub> with cell type and association of  HS and E<sub>max</sub> with drug class</h2>
<p class="normal">We used mutual information analysis to quantify the extent to which each of the dose response parameters were associated with either cell or drug type. Our analysis showed that parameters quantifying maximum effect (E<sub>max</sub> and E<sub>inf</sub> ) exhibited strong association with cell type. For example, all but three drugs exhibited an equal or higher value for E<sub>max</sub> in SKBR3 cells than in SUM159PT cells. Prevailing “fractional kill” theory posits that inhibitors of cell-cycle progression (such as paclitaxel) kill only the subset of cells that pass through S or M phases in the presence of drug. Consistent with this, SKBR3 had a substantially longer doubling time than SUM159PT cells (~50 vs. ~20 hr, and thus lower mitotic and S phase fractions) under the growth conditions used in this study. When we calculated the correlation between dose-response parameters and cell doubling time for all 64 drugs, we observed a strong positive correlation between E<sub>max</sub> or IC<sub>50</sub> and doubling time, particularly in the case of DNA damaging agents and microtubule stabilizers. However, when we excluded nominally cell-cycle specific drugs from the analysis, the association between cell line and both E<sub>max</sub> and E<sub>inf</sub> was weaker. </p>
<p class="normal">We observed a strong association between drug type and potency, efficacy and steepness of the dose-response relationships meaning that virtually all pairs of drugs could be distinguished based on cell-line dependent variation in one or more parameters. For example, the parameters IC<sub>50</sub>, E<sub>max</sub> and HS allowed high confidence (<i>P</i> = 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup>) discrimination between the pairs of drugs (i) oxamflatin and vorinostat (two HDAC inhibitors), (ii) MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor) and 17-AAG (an HSP90 inhibitor) and (iii) GSK1059615 (a PI3K inhibitor) and trichostatin A (an HDAC inhibitor). When we grouped drugs into classes based on nominal target or mechanism of action (ignoring potential secondary targets and poly-pharmacology), we observed significant differences between the HS and E<sub>max</sub> across different classes of drugs. For example, HDAC inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and DNA cross-linking drugs had uniformly high maximal effects (E<sub>max</sub> ~ E<sub>inf</sub>  ~ 0) whereas inhibitors of EGFR and HSP90 exhibited large variation in E<sub>max</sub>. In the case of Hill slope, mTOR inhibitors exhibited HS values significantly less than one, whereas HS values of   for HDAC and proteasome inhibitors were significantly greater than one.</p>

<h2>Cell-to-cell variability and shallow dose-response curves</h2>
<p class="normal">To investigate how a shallow dose-response curve might arise we focused on drugs inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway that varied widely in HS and E<sub>max</sub> values independent of proliferation rate. For three compounds with varying HS, we measured target inhibition by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell killing in four breast cell lines (HER2-amplified AU565 and HCC1954 cancer cells, hormone receptor-positive T47D cancer cells, and non-transformed MCF10A cells). We probed the effects of the PI3K inhibitor GSK1059615, mTOR inhibitor PP242, and dual specificity PI3K/mTOR inhibitor Dactolisib (BEZ235) 24 hr after drug exposure in 9-point dose-response assays using antibodies specific for p-Akt (Ser473), p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46), and p-S6 (Ser235/236). We also measured levels of phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb at Ser807/811) as a surrogate for commitment to the cell cycle. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed dose-dependent inhibition of p-Akt, p-4EBP1 and p-S6 and viability assays performed 72 hr after drug exposure confirmed shallow Hill slopes for PP242 and Dactolisib and HS ~ 1 for GSK1059615 in all cell lines. However, we also observed substantial cell-to-cell variability in phospho-protein staining intensity for cells exposed to the first two drugs. The presence of a subset of cells in which the Akt/mTOR/PI3K pathway is insensitive to inhibition by PP242 or Dactolisib is a likely explanation for fractional cell killing by these drugs (E<sub>max</sub> > 0).

<h2>Variation of cell line responsiveness to each drug class</h2>
<p class="normal">Finally, we determined the ability of each single parameter to accurately describe a full dose-response relationship. We computed the correlation between the response estimated from a single parameter of a conventional logistic curve and the measured response. We performed the analysis across the range of doses for all drugs and cell lines by scoring the <i>P</i>-values of the correlation coefficient. We observed that E<sub>max</sub> was best correlated with actual response at high doses, IC<sub>50</sub> and AUC were best at intermediate doses (near the median IC<sub>50</sub> for all cell lines) and EC<sub>50</sub> or GI<sub>50</sub> were best at low doses (near the IC<sub>50</sub> for the most sensitive cell line). This is depicted as continuous plots for 17-AAG, carboplatin and doxorubicin and for the full dataset, as a set of optimal parameters for each dose range.  A priori, we are most interested in analyzing drugs at clinically relevant concentration ranges. We can estimate these ranges from the plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) at the maximal tolerated dose (MTD); in general, effective drugs are ones in which C<sub>max</sub>/IC<sub>50</sub> &#8811; 1. Incorporating this information we saw that, in the clinical range, the most informative parameter varied with drug; for example, AUC for 17-AAG, IC<sub>50</sub> for carboplatin and E<sub>max</sub> for doxorubicin.

(b) Predictive value of different dose-response parameters for drug sensitivity is a function of the clinical concentration of drug.
