      <h2>Scatterplot browser</h2>
          <p>This browser widget serves to explore the dose-response data analyzed in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.1337">Fallahi-Sichani, et al. (2013)</a>, by overlaying multiple "cell line vs. cell line" or "drug vs. drug" scatterplots like those shown in Figure&nbsp;4&nbsp;(a, c, d, e).  The different scatterplots shown in the widget's right-hand panel correspond to different dose-response metrics.</p>
          <p>The scatterplots to be displayed are specified by selecting <i>pairs</i> of either cell lines or drugs; each such pair is selected by clicking on its members' names in the Selection Panel (to the left of the plots).  Hovering the cursor over the names in the Selection Panel gives a rapid scan over the available data; clicking on a name fixes the choice.  (For more info, click on the &#x24d8; icon.)</p>

          <p>USAGE:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>first specify the desired plot type (if necessary);</li>
            <li>next, choose the entity corresponding to the <i>x</i>-axes by clicking on its name in the Selection Panel; this choice serves as the "anchor" for all subsequent selections, but it can be changed easily, as described below;</li>
            <li>finally, select one or more entities for the <i>y</i>-axes, by clicking on their names; selecting an entity for the <i>y</i>-axis in this way amounts to selecting a new pair; each newly selected pair gets added to a running list of selected pairs, shown below the Selection Panel; this list of selected pairs persists until the <span class="button-reference">clear</span> button is pressed, or the current plot type is changed;</li>
            <li>to select a different "anchor" for the <i>x</i>-axes, click on the previously selected one to deselect it (this will not affect any previously selected pairs), and then proceed as before; (it is possible to choose the <i>x</i>-axis identifier also for the <i>y</i>-axis, by holding down the shift key while clicking on the <i>x</i>-axis identifier the second time).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>NOTES:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the thin marks along either axis correspond to points for which only the coordinate for that axis is available;</li>
            <li>a cross-shaped mark represents points for which neither coordinate is available (such a cross-shaped mark, when present, always appears on the diagonal, near the lower left corner of the plot);</li>
            <li>hovering the cursor over a marker in the scatterplot highlights all the other markers (across all the plots) corresponding to the drug or cell line associated with it, and, after a short wait, it also brings up the name of this drug or cell line;
            <li>performance and appearance vary across web browsers; in our experience, Chrome is best, followed by Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer (11+), and Opera, in roughly that order.</li>
