<h2>Responses of genetically diverse cell lines to biological ligands</h2>

<p>Peptidyl ligands (cytokines, chemokines and growth factors) are among the
  most important naturally occurring perturbagens. They play a role in
  regulating cell motility, differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and cell
  survival.  Growth factors are one class of biological ligands that function by
  binding to one or more of the 58 known human receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  and activating “immediate early” signaling by MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and other kinase
  cascades.</p>

<h2>Description of the dataset and downloads</h2>

<p>This dataset describes the responsiveness of a canonical collection
  of 39 breast cancer cell lines of the
  <a href="{% flatpage_static %}breast_cancer_signaling/g/cell-line/data/cell_line_info.xlsx">NCI-ICBP43
  set</a>, whose genotypes span many of the mutations observed in primary
  disease <a class="ref" href="#ref-1-neve">1</a>. The data comprises the
  phosphorylation levels of ERK (MAPK1/3) and Akt (Akt/1/2/3) kinases following
  exposure to 15 growth factors and cytokines, at two doses and three time
  points, as well as the abundance and phosphorylation levels of 20 RTKs and
  several additional intracellular proteins. We previously used this dataset to
  predict the sensitivity of the cell lines to 43 therapeutic inhibitors by
  statistical modeling <a class="ref" href="#ref-2-niepel">2</a>. Here we
  explore in more detail how the the signaling responses vary across the cell
  lines and how the responses relate to the basal expression and activity levels
  of RTKs <a class="ref" href="#ref-3-niepel">3</a>.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The goals for this dataset were to: (i) characterize the diversity of growth
  factor response and determine how it mapped to clinical subtypes, (ii)
  identify factors that control the magnitude and duration of ligand response
  and (iii) generate a simple means to look up and compare ligand-response data
  that have hitherto been unavailable or scatted across the literature. To this
  end, we have produced several "views" of the dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#data-response-matrix">Response matrix</a>: Graphical lookup tables
    summarizing the signaling responses across all experimental conditions.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="#data-by-cell-line">By cell line</a>: Analysis and visualization of
    dataset slices corresponding to data from individual cell lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#data-by-ligand">By ligand</a>: Analysis and visualization of
    dataset slices corresponding to data from individual ligand treatments.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-by-cell-line">Data by Cell Line</h2>

<p>A compact overview of both the basal and signaling profiles of each cell are
simple network maps displayed as node-edge graphs. This visualization allows the user to
quickly identify which pathways are highly expressed, strongly phosphorylated, or
particularly sensitive in a given cell lines. The outer and inner circles
represent basal measurements with circle size indicating expression levels and
the shading indicating phosphorylation levels. The data is normalized across all
cell lines and gray outer circles denote phosphorylation levels below the
threshold of detection. The lines between the outer and middle circles denote
simplified ligand/receptor binding. The colored arrows between the outer and
middle circles denote the strength of pERK (blue) or pAkt (red) induction by
ligand. The maximal response by ligand was normalized across all responses and
gray lines denote responses that are not significant.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.cell_line_nodeedge %}

<p>To put the individual network maps into context we created three maps that
represent each clinical subtype (TNBC, HER2amp, HR+). To create these maps we
used the trimmed mean of all values of a given subtype, rather than the mean,
to reduce artifacts that might occur due to ligand/receptor combinations that
only result in sporadic responses.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.subtype_nodeedge %}

<p>We can also plot the distribution of individual signaling features by
subtype. Here we show the fraction of responses to low doses of ligands by pERK
and pAkt. For example, TNBCs are particularly sensitive and respond even to low
doses of ligand when measuring pERK. No such difference is apparent when looking at pAkt.
Other features that can be similarly compared are the mean fold-changes at treatment
with high doses of ligand or the pERK/pAkt induction bias. We then show the data
of individual cell types by a diamond overlayed on the overall distribution of the
subtypes. </p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.cell_line_subtype %}

<p>Also the basal expression and phosphorylation levels of RTKs have a wide
distribution across all cell lines. For each cell line we can highlight the
most upregulated and downregulated basal measurements. We indicated the level
of a given cell line by a diamond overlayed on the distribution of the same measurement
across all lines. The distributions by subtype are indicated as colored bars.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.cell_line_topmeasures %}

<p>The magnitude of response to individual ligands varies significantly from one
cell line to the next. We can illustrate this range of responses as boxplot for each
ligand for pERK and pAkt fold-changes. Again, we can indicate the measurement of any
given cell line as a diamond, to put a single cell line into its appropriate context.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.cell_line_foldchange %}

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/sibling_browser.html" with class="ligand" all_names=ligand_names %}

<h2 id="data-by-ligand">Data by Ligand</h2>

<p>We can display the full time courses for individual ligand/downstream kinase combination
across all cell lines to see both the variance in the kinetics and the magnitude
of the responses. For a given ligand there are two plots corresponding to a low and
high dose treatment and the two different downstream targets. We chose six cell lines
that are highlighted in every plot that can be used a reference they that cover much
of the variablity observed in the whole data set.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.ligand_timecourse %}

<p>We can then classify these time course into four kinetic response classes
(sustained, transient, late, none) and plot their distribution by target and 
ligand-family. This shows that certain ligands predominantly give responses of certain
classes, like the ErbB/FGF responses being mainly sustained or the INS/IGF responses
being often late. We can then compare the response to individual ligands to the
main ligand-families.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.ligand_responsekinetics %}

<p>Even though we collected responses only at two doses, we can
use this data to approximate the sensitivity of any cell line to a particular
ligand. Analogous to the time courses above, we can plot the response of all cell
lines to a specific ligand measured by a specific downstream kinase across the two doses.
</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.ligand_doseresponse %}

<p>We find that there is a significant range in the magnitude of responses both at
low and high dose. This means we can classify these sensitivities based on
whether cells respond equally at high and low dose, higher at high than at low
dose, only at high dose, or not at all. Once classified this way we can plot the overall
distribution of these sensitivity classes for all cell lines given a ligand/downstream
kinase combination. This shows that certain ligands measured by certain targets
predominantly fall into certain classes, like the ErbB and FGF responses being higher
at high dose than at low dose meaning they are rarely saturated at low dose.</p>

{% include "breast_cancer_signaling/titled_figures.html" with a=fig_args.ligand_sensitivity %}

<p>When we compare the pERK and pAkt response for the same ligand in a single cell line
(see above) it is apparent that individual ligands induce a pathway bias. We can plot
this bias as the response angle distribution or boxplots to compare individual ligands
to the remaining ligands. When browsing individual ligands we highlight it in black so
it stands out in contrast to the other ligands.</p>
